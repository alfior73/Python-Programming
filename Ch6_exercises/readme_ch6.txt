Assignments
-----------
Chapter 6 examples


Description
-----------
ex1. 
 Write a while loop that starts at the last character in the string and works 
 its way backwards to the first character in the string, printing each letter 
 on a separate line, except backwards.

ex2. 
  Given that fruit is a string, what does fruit[:] mean?
  Fruit[:] will print out the full string

ex3.
  Encapsulate this code in a function named count, and generalize
  it so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.

ex4.
  There is a string method called count that is similar to the function in the previous exercise.
  Write an invocation that counts the number of times the letter a occurs in “banana”.

ex5.
  Take the following Python code that stores a string:
  str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'
  Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string 
  after the colon character and then use the float function to convert 
  the extracted string into a floating point number.

ex6.
  Read the documentation of the string methods at
  https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods 
  You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you 
  understand how they work. strip and replace are particularly useful.
  The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. 
  For example, in find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate 
  optional arguments. So sub is required, but start is optional, 
  and if you include start, then end is optional.


Instructions
------------
All programs run with a simple python command 
Depending on the program/script it'll ask for input or not. 
You can do as the examples states in the chapter or you can freestyle and input what you'd like. 
"done" will end program and output the final results for examples from the book. 
Depending on the problem set, they have independant values that will quit the program...if you want to try it COME ON DOWN!

Completion Statement
--------------------
I was able to complete most parts of the assignment by myself.
