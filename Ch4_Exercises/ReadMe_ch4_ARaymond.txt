Assignments
-----------
Problem set 3


Description
-----------
ex1. This is an example program that showcases the random function
ex2. This is an example program that shows that you'll get an error if you call a function before defining it

ex3. This is an example program that shows that it doesn't matter where the defined function is in the script as long as it's defined before it's called

ex4. This is an example program that shows the purpose of the "def" keyword 
ex5. This is an example program that shows how the order of calling a function and the output it produces

ex6. This a redesigned program of the pay script from a previous chapter utilizing functions
ex7. This a redesigned program of the grading script from a previous chapter utilizing functions

Problem Set 3 Part 1
- Enter inputs and output name and whether or not age is valid or not

Problem Set 3 Part 2
- Debug the code and fix errors.

Instructions
------------
All programs run with a simple python command 
Depending on the program/script it'll ask for input or not. You can do as the examples states in the chapter or you can freestyle and input what you'd like.

Completion Statement
--------------------
I was able to complete most parts of the assignment by myself. The most
challenging part of the chapter exercises was the retooling of existing code to incorporate new functions ie. for the grading exercise I had to reverse the order of the conditional statements in my function. I also styled the output in problem set 3 part 2 just to make it look nicer or as nice can be.

I viewed some of the examples presented in Blackboard in assisting with redesigning of the final exercise ie. ex7.
