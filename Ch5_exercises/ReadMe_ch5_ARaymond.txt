Assignments
-----------
Problem set 4 + Chapter 5 examples


Description
-----------
ex1. This is an example program that totals, counts and averages the numbers entered
ex2. This is an example program that finds the smallest and largest value entered

Problem Set 4 part 1 - Enter an age between 0 - 150 or don't and see what happens. It's a program that will tell you if the age is valid or not. If it's less than 0 it's invalid and if it's higher than 150 than it's invalid. It'll keep going round and round until it gets a valid age. Once valid, it'll quit. 


Instructions
------------
All programs run with a simple python command 
Depending on the program/script it'll ask for input or not. You can do as the examples states in the chapter or you can freestyle and input what you'd like. "done" will end program and output the final results for examples from the book. Depending on the problem set, they have independant values that will quit the program...if you want to try it COME ON DOWN!

Completion Statement
--------------------
I was able to complete most parts of the assignment by myself. 

ex1. Took a bit of time...I tried to put everything in functions but it's all self contained in the while loop.
ex2. I was trying to seperate out the min/max functionality to functions but it would only reset the values so everything had to stay in the main function.

Problem sets are nice to test my skills on...when a problem set arises can the solution be found quickly or does it need time to percolate. A programmer can often sit for a period of time and go down a rabbit hole and get aggrevated so it's best to learn to get up and step away to clear the slate/take a break and return to the problem at a later time.
