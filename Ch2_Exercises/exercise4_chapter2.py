#
# Assume that we execute the following assignment state- ments:
# width = 17
# height = 12.0
#
# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the
# expression and the type (of the value of the expression).
# 
# 1. width//2   2. width/2.0  3. height/3   4. 1 + 2 * 5
# N/A


width = 17
height = 12.0

width = width//2
print("width//2 is: ", width)
print(type(width))

width = 17
width = width/2.0
print("\nwidth/2.0 is: ", width)
print(type(width))

height = height/3
print("\nheight is :", height)
print(type(height))

basicCalculation = 1+2*5
print("\n1+2*5: ", basicCalculation)
print(type(basicCalculation))
