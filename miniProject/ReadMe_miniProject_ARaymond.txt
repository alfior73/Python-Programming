Assignments

Mini Project


Description
-----------
Write a program that meets the following requirements:
o	Print some instructions to explain what is going to happen and then print the menu using the information above
o	Ask the user to select an option. When the option is selected, run a function that completes the task.
o	Your program must define and use at least 3 functions but more is better 
o	at least one must be fruitful (it must return a value)
o	at least one must take input parameter



Instructions
------------
All programs run with a simple python command 
Depending on the prompt it'll ask for input
Use "Done" to get out of the fortune teller or the knock knock function
Use option 4 to get out of the whole program


Completion Statement
--------------------
I was able to complete the assignment by myself. 

Knock knock function was the most complex as it was a loop within a loop

Mad Libs was tricky with the passing of the final print statement to return it out of the function.
